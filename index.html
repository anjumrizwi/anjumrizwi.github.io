    Directory Guide
    Faculty profiles contain data from several different sources.

    KmData
    KmData is an ODEE led, cross university initiative to connect data from different silos such as Human Resources, Research in View, Student Information Systems, the Identity Management Project, and a host of other systems.  We get most of our data from KmData, but it usually originates in these other systems.  Data comes into KmData on a daily basis, sometimes more frequently.  We in turn, update information from KmData on a daily basis.  This means there should be a maximum of two days lag in the propagation of updates.

    Research in View
    In a complete profile, most information comes from Research in View, the Thompson-Reuters-powered successor to OSU Pro.  This is the official system used by the university for tenure tracking and faculty reporting.  While the intent is to make all non-private RiV data available in profiles, this is what we currently have.
